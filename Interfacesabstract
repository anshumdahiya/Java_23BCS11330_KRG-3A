Abstract Class:
It can have both abstract and normal methods.
It can store data using variables and can also have a constructor.
A class can extend only one abstract class.
Methods inside it can be public, protected or private.
It is used when different classes share some common features or code.

Interface:
It mainly contains abstract methods.
It cannot store normal variables — only constants.
A class can implement multiple interfaces at the same time.
All abstract methods inside an interface are always public.
It is used when you want to define a common behavior that many different classes should follow.
